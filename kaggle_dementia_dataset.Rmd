## About Longitudinal research 
<!-- 

A longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96 refers to a study or data collection effort where information on 150 individuals within this age range is gathered over an extended period. In longitudinal studies, researchers repeatedly collect data from the same subjects over time, allowing them to observe changes and trends in specific variables, such as health status, cognitive function, or behavior, as the subjects age. This type of study can provide valuable insights into how various factors evolve with age and can highlight trends relevant to the aging process, the development of age-related conditions, or the impact of interventions over time.

## Package Loading Function
```{r}
pkgTest <- function(pkg){
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg)) install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}
lapply(c("tidyverse"), pkgTest)
```


## Data Summary
```{r}
# View the first few rows
head(dementia_data)

# View data structure
str(dementia_data)

# Summary statistics
summary(dementia_data)

# Count missing values
colSums(is.na(dementia_data))

# Mean, median, and standard deviation of Age, MMSE, and eTIV
mean(dementia_data$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
median(dementia_data$MMSE, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(dementia_data$eTIV, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## Visualizations

```{r}
# Age histogram using ggplot2
ggplot(dementia_data, aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Age", x = "Age", y = "Frequency")

# Boxplot for Age
boxplot(dementia_data$Age, main = "Boxplot of Age", ylab = "Values")

# Bar plot for categorical variable 'Group'
ggplot(dementia_data, aes(x = Group)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Group Distribution", x = "Group", y = "Count")
```

## Group Summarization
```{r}
# Summary statistics by Group
dementia_data %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    mean_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_age = sd(Age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
