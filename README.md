# Dementia Kaggle Project

## Overview

This project analyzes dementia-related data, focusing on key insights and predictive modeling for cognitive decline and related conditions.

## Dementia Kaggle Dataset

The dataset contains 373 entries with 15 variables, each related to subjects in a dementia study. Here’s a breakdown of each variable:

1. **Subject ID**: Unique identifier for each subject.
2. **MRI ID**: Unique identifier for each MRI session, including multiple entries for subjects with multiple visits.
3. **Group**: The group classification of the subject, either "Demented" or "Nondemented".
4. **Visit**: Visit number for longitudinal study participants.
5. **MR Delay**: Delay in days between the baseline visit and the MRI scan.
6. **M/F**: Subject’s gender ("M" for male, "F" for female).
7. **Hand**: Dominant hand of the subject (e.g., "R" for right).
8. **Age**: Age of the subject at the time of the MRI scan.
9. **EDUC**: Years of education.
10. **SES**: Socioeconomic status, with some missing values.
11. **MMSE**: Mini-Mental State Examination score, assessing cognitive function (some missing values).
12. **CDR**: Clinical Dementia Rating, a measure of dementia severity.
13. **eTIV**: Estimated total intracranial volume.
14. **nWBV**: Normalized whole-brain volume.
15. **ASF**: Atlas scaling factor, related to MRI scan measurements.

This dataset provides demographic, clinical, and MRI-based information, with variables that allow tracking of cognitive status and brain volume changes across different visits.
